% Representation of Relationships & Logics in MATLAB
A = 1:9
B = 10-A

r0 = (A<4)  % Judgement
r1 = (A == B)


% Comment: the representation of logics is similar to any other
% programming languages. However, as the CHARACTERISTIC of MATLAB,
% it's much more convinient to use those "Logic Array" to, say,
% select part of the elements in a big array. And as the name suggests,
% it could act as a FILTER. Amazed? That's the magic of Mathematics.
